> *paper-mod* is a fork of [Hugo PaperMod][hugo-PaperMod] which itself is a theme based on [hugo-paper][hugo-paper].
> 
> This fork exists to serve a very limited audience: *me*. To anyone else, I recommend using the original [Hugo PaperMod][hugo-PaperMod] project instead. While I do plan to keep *paper-mod* updated with the upstream changes, for one there's no gurantee on this, and for two, I ignore upstream changes that I feel do not add value to the direction I want to take *paper-mod* in!

The [demo][demo-site] includes a some documentation regarding installation, features and some stuff. You are recommended to start with taking a look at the demo site to get an idea of what it looks like!

A live demo site can be found [here][demo-site]. The demo site is built through the branch [`demo`][demo-tree] as source.
